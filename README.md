The git branches of this repository hold stable versions of the extension for older versions of Radiant CMS. For example the _0.8_ branch is compatible with Radiant 0.8.

    cd vendor/extensions/custom_fields

As an example, if you're working on Radiant 0.8 you will need to checkout the 0.8 branch:
    
    cd vendor/extensions/custom_fields
    git checkout -b my_branch origin/0.8
